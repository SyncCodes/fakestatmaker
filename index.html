    <div class="whatisfsm">What is FSM? FSM stands for Fake Statistic Maker, it is within no correlation with LCEdit. FSM is a personal project of mine that I have been working on for most of the year, (95% of the year was learning more about html, css, and java.) and I made it for one to test my coding skills, and this is just something I kind of just wanted to do for a while.</div>

        FSM is basically an inspect element tool, without the prospect of losing everything once you refresh. (You will lose everything if do you refresh, thats why the Save button exists, and maybe I will get an autosave feature to save your data to the cloud.) FSM will start off with 3 sites, PFR, Statmuse, and Socialblade. There will 100% be more sites coming and you can request some in the website-suggestions for FSM.
